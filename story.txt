I am working on my cs homework from my work
Typing on my computer, I find a small window pops on my screen: "what did the star say?"
 $"Le roi est de retour"

Then it said "omelette du fromage " 

the french are known for having the best breakfast of the world but little do people know that the croissant is not actually 
french. the croissant is an austrian origin dish.
